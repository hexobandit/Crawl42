# Crawl42
 The answer to authenticated crawling and everything ðŸ¤–

- âœ… Logs in and handles different authentication methods (JWT, session cookies, CSRF tokens)
- âœ… Extracts JWT from localStorage, cookies, or network headers
- âœ… Captures all XHR/fetch API requests for endpoint discovery
- âœ… Extracts all internal links from the authenticated session
- âœ… Handles CSRF tokens if present
- âœ… Avoids bot detection (stealth mode, random delays)
